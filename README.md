# Introduction

# Description
In this post we will learn how to make our own homeautomation system using our own MQTT cloud broker.

# Details
The article is being published in collaboration with JLCPCB. It is one of the most experienced PCB manufacturers withmore than a decade in the field of PCB prototype and fabrication, they are committed to meeting the needs of ourcustomers from different industries in terms of quality, delivery, cost-effectiveness and any other demanding requests.

# Introduction

In this homeautomation System, we are able to control our home-appliances by an smartphone and also we can control it with manual switches and monitor the real time status on the smartphone.

This project will work from anywhere in the world, because this is a cloud based MQTT broker.

# Reyax MQTT Cloud broker.

For making of this homeautomation project, Iam going to use Reyax RYC1001 MQTT Iot cloud plateform. Which you can easily purchase from amazon.com.

To control the homeappliances through smartphone, we also need a MQTT Client in our smartphone, for that we will use iotonoff mobile appliaction, this app is available for both Android as well as for IOS ; You can easily download it from APP Store or from playstore.

#Components Required.

1.ESP32

2.Highlink AC to DC Convertor(HLK-PM01)

3.Relay (5volt)

4.BC 547 NPN transistor.

5.IN4007 Diode.

6.Resistor (1 & 10 kohm)

7.Two Pin terminal connector.

8.Coustom Designed PCB.


# Ordering the PCBs at jlcpcb.
This project is sponsored by jlcpcb. jlcpcb is a full feature Printed Circuit Board manufacturing service.

Turn your DIY breadboard circuits into professional PCBs – get 10 boards for approximately $5 + shipping (which will vary depending on your country).

Once you have your Gerber files, you can order the PCB. Follow the next steps.

1. Download the Gerber files – click here to download the .zip file

2. Go to https://jlcpcb.com/RAT website and Click on Quote Now button. 

3.Upload the gerber file you downloaded in the last step. Upload the.zip file or you can also drag and drop the gerber files. 

After uploading the zip file, you’ll see a success message at the bottom if   the file is successfully uploaded. You can review the PCB in the Gerber viewer to make sure everything is good.
jlcpcb can grab all the PCB details and automatically fills them for you.
